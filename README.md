# lazy_econ

Hi.
I don't like doing economics. It's repetitive and boring. So, instead of putting compound interest factors into my calculator a million times, I made functions for them instead. Then I put them on GitHub because I wanted them on my desktop PC. Then I thought about putting this module on pip before realizing that maybe I should get back to studying (I'll do it next time I want to put off calculating an IRR).
